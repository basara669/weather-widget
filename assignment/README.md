# Technical Test

The purpose of this test is for us to get a sense of how you would approach designing and implementing a JavaScript/CSS/HTML weather widget. Applicants are encouraged to write code for this test as for a production grade application.

There's more than one way to skin a cat, therefore feel free to list down your assumptions as you go along (e.g. in code comments).

Although not required, you can use any front-end framework you like. Vue.js will be looked upon favourably.

### Requirements

Based on the wireframe, create a “weather widget” that shows your location's current and future weather data. Wireframes are intentionally left plain for maximum creativity!

##### Widget

The widget should read the end user’s current location using `navigator.geolocation`, and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Defaulted to the current time, users should be able to navigate between the days.

### Deliverables

There is no strict time limit but most people get back to us within a few days. Source code for the solution described above: share your repository or forward a zip file of the source code.
